          What is a Cookie?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
          A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
          when you visit. It typically contains information about the website
          itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognize your web
          browser when you return, additional data that serves the cookie’s
          purpose, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g., logging in), track
          site usage (e.g., analytics), store your user settings (e.g., time
          zone, notification preferences), and to personalize your content
          (e.g., advertising, language).

          First-Party and Third-Party Cookies
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
          Cookies set by the website you are visiting are referred to as
          first-party cookies. They typically only track your activity on that
          particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e., third
          parties) are called third-party cookies, and they can be used to track
          you across other websites that use the same third-party service
